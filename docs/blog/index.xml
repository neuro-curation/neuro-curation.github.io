      <description>This page is intended to give you a feeling of what a blog post looks like. Crab supports both fixed (static) pages as well as blog posts.
In order to make blog pages work correctly, you need proper permalinks settings in your site&amp;rsquo;s config.toml.
Hugo will then treat all files in the blog directory (for example) like blog posts.
Have a look at the config.toml provided with this example site, as well as the page about Permalinks from the Hugo docs.</description>
